# Magic-the-Gathering
###Webscraping python tools for Magic the Gathering

#### Webscrawl.py
My first webscraper written in Python. This code uses the official MTG webpages and MTG Goldfish to create an excel table and text table of all the information about Magic cards. Code is GPL - free use.

#### MTG.py
Code uses Deckbrew API for the basic card info listed in MTG.py.
